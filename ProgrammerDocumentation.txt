GoodFoodGoneBad contains five activities with designations: Main, Homescreen, Log-In, Profile, and  New Item. 
The Sign-In activity implements a FacebookFragment that extends the Fragment interface to allow the user to use
their facebook credentials and give the application their name, email, and phone number information, which are 
returned in JSON format.
The returned JSON object is parsed and the Profile Activityâ€™s layout is populated with the information.
The New Item Activity allows a user to select the expiration date through a calendar and the purchase date is 
stored as the current date.

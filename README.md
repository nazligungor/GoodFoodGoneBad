Motivation
While keeping track of expiration dates might appear menial at a glance, forgetting through the distractions and obligations of everyday life can result in significant financial waste and time drain. We hope that through our app our users can develop financially responsible, waste-reducing, and time-saving habits by logging their grocery information.

Permissions
In order to streamline the process of obtaining profile information and with hopes of expanding our application in the future to include social networking opportunities, we use the Facebook log-in API to obtain name, email, and phone number information. This information is not obtained or accessed for any purpose other than to properly populate the profile page of the application.
